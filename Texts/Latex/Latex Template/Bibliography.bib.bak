  abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation
	for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map
	function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate
	key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate
	values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world
	tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper.},

  abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective
	feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth
	and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple
	laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components
	with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this
	design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and
	it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition
	for several days.},
