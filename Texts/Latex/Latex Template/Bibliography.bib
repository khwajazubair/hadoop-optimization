	We live in the data age. It’s not easy to measure the total volume of data stored elec-
tronically, but an IDC estimate put the size of the “digital universe” at 0.18 zettabytes
in 2006 and is forecasting a tenfold growth by 2011 to 1.8 zettabytes. A zettabyte is
1021 bytes, or equivalently one thousand exabytes, one million petabytes, or one billion
terabytes. That’s roughly the same order of magnitude as one disk drive for every person
in the world..},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

	Abstract = {We present a review of the use of diode lasers in atomic physics with an extensive list of references. We discuss the relevant characteristics of diode lasers and explain how to purchase and use them. We also review the various techniques that have been used to control and narrow the spectral outputs of diode lasers. Finally we present a number of examples illustrating the use of diode lasers in atomic physics experiments. Review of Scientific Instruments is copyrighted by The American Institute of Physics.},
